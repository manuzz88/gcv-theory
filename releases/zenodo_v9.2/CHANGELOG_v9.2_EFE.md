## UNIQUE PREDICTION: External Field Effect (EFE)

This is a prediction that ONLY GCV/MOND can make!
Dark matter theory CANNOT explain this!

## The Concept

In GCV, the vacuum "organizes" around mass to enhance gravity.

But what if there's already a strong external gravitational field?

The vacuum is already "occupied" by the external field!
Less room for additional organization = SUPPRESSED chi_v!

## The Formula

```
chi_v = 1 + A * (1 - exp(-r/L_c)) * 1/(1 + g_ext/a0)
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                    EFE suppression term
```

When g_ext (external field) is large:
- The suppression term becomes small
- chi_v approaches 1
- No gravitational boost!

## Predictions

### Satellite Galaxies Near Milky Way

| Satellite | Distance | g_ext/a0 | chi_v Suppression |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Sagittarius | 20 kpc | 1.94 | **66%** |
| Draco | 76 kpc | 0.13 | 12% |
| Sculptor | 86 kpc | 0.10 | 10% |
| Fornax | 138 kpc | 0.04 | 4% |
| Leo I | 254 kpc | 0.01 | 1% |

Satellites CLOSER to MW have MORE suppressed chi_v!

## "Dark Matter Free" Galaxies Explained!

In 2018, NGC 1052-DF2 and DF4 were discovered with very low velocity dispersions.
Scientists were puzzled: "Galaxies without dark matter?"

GCV explanation:
- These galaxies are NEAR massive NGC 1052
- The external field SUPPRESSES their chi_v
- They appear to have "no dark matter"
- But it's just EFE!

## Why Dark Matter Cannot Explain This

Dark matter is made of PARTICLES. Each galaxy has its own halo.

Question: Does Sagittarius's dark matter halo "know" the Milky Way is nearby?
Answer: NO! Dark matter particles don't interact (except gravity).

In LCDM:
- Isolated dwarf = Satellite dwarf (same internal dynamics)
- No suppression predicted

In GCV:
- The vacuum is ONE FIELD filling all space
- External field "pre-organizes" the vacuum
- Satellite has SUPPRESSED chi_v

## This Is a Smoking Gun Test!

| Observation | LCDM Prediction | GCV Prediction |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Satellite sigma | Same as isolated | LOWER than isolated |
| DF2/DF4 | Anomaly, unexplained | Natural EFE effect |
| Correlation with distance | None | Strong! |

If EFE is confirmed, LCDM is RULED OUT!

## Current Evidence

1. **Crater II**: sigma = 2.7 km/s (LCDM predicts ~10)
2. **NGC 1052-DF2/DF4**: Very low sigma near massive host
3. **MW satellites**: Systematic M/L differences with distance

All consistent with EFE!

## Complete Formula

```
chi_v(r, M, g_ext) = 1 + A * (1 - exp(-r/L_c)) * 1/(1 + g_ext/a0)

where:
  L_c = sqrt(G*M/a0)
  a0 = 1.80e-10 m/s^2
  A ~ 1.2
```
